title: 2020 Coordinated readings
subtitle: To help educate evolutionary biologists about the kinds of questions that marine scientists care about and to help educate marine scientists about the kinds of questions that evolutionary biologists care about, we have developed a recommended reading list of papers about phenotypic plasticity.

To facilitate discussions aamong members of the RCN, we have set up Slack channel at [evolvingseas.slack.com](evolvingseas.slack.com). To join the channel please [visit this site](https://join.slack.com/t/evolvingseas/shared_invite/enQtNTI4MjcwMjg5NTM5LWFiMGM0OTczMzllODg3NGQxYzBlNTA4NTE2OWI5ZWEwNjU3MTQ2ZTk3OWYxMjA5NzQxMmQwNTVmZDE1ZGE0NDc). The steering committee has developed a reading list for Spring 2020, with a schedule for discussions every two weeks. We encourage you to discuss the papers with other participants prior to joining the larger discussion on slack. For each topic, your group should choose one person to post a summary to the Slack channel that summarizes the group’s reaction to the papers and discussion questions. We have made efforts to improve representation and diversity in our selected readings. Please scroll to the bottom of this page for a diversity summary.

To form a discussion group 1) Start a group at your home institution and meet once or twice during each two-week period (any time during the two weeks is fine) to read and discuss the papers, 2) Discuss papers virtually before joining the larger discussion via the #Virtual_Discussion group on the RCN slack. 

## Navigating Slack

All participants can use the thread feature in Slack to post additional questions, and react to comments or questions posed by other groups. Additionally, this year we will have a weekly thread dedicated to resolving questions that emerge from the readings. Moderators will monitor threads and respond to questions. We encourage individuals or groups to use these threads to clarify any uncertainties. 

Under `Channels` click the `+` and search for `2020-spring-readings`

Each week will have two threads: 
  * Under the thread `Week X. <Topic Name> Post your group's discussions here,` click on the chat icon `Reply to thread` to post a summary of your group's discussions (see image below).
  * To ask a question about the papers, use the thread `Week X. <Topic Name> Questions for Understanding.` If you have any technical questions about the papers, post them here and the moderators will do their best to answer them!

## New Theme and Format
For our second set of coordinated readings, we focus on phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a single genotype to express different phenotypes in different environments. Plasticity has the potential to promote adaptation, constrain adaptation, or be the adaptive response itself, so it plays an important role in adaptation to changing environments. 

A central goal of the RCN-ECS is to synthesize and integrate ideas about evolution in changing seas. This year, rather than posting questions unique to each week's theme, we have two overarching questions to serve as guideposts for weekly discussions. We will devote the final week for groups to gather together, synthesize previous discussions, and provide answers to the two questions. We encourage groups to generate bold and testable predictions and to distance themselves from simply summarizing past discussions. 

## Discussion Questions: 

**1. Under what conditions do we expect plasticity to evolve, and in what traits? When will plasticity be adaptive, nonadaptive (neutral), or maladaptive?**

**2. What are the conditions (organismal traits, genomic, theoretical, etc) in which plasticity promotes/constrains adaptation?**


## Note that the date posted for each week below is the date we expect the discussion to be completed and summaries posted to the Slack channel.

## Week 1 (Deadline for discussion February 7)

### Topic - Definitions of plasticity

**Rationale:**
There are myriad forms that phenotypic plasticity can take with many different terms to describe these patterns. These papers will help the RCN establish shared language and examine the utility and origins of these definitions. 

**Paper 1:**  (Paper and Link)

[Evolution of phenotypic plasticity: patterns of plasticity and the emergence of ecotypes](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2005.01322.x%4010.1002/%28ISSN%291469-8137%28CAT%29SpecialIssues%28VI%29Plantecologicaldevelopment)

## Week 6 (April 17):

### Topic: Synthesis

**Rationale:**

Please use this week to synthesize your group's discussions from the past five readings and prepare answers to the two overarching questions. Again, we encourage groups to consider the discussions from the perspective of future research and provide answers in the form of testable predictions. 

In addition, groups may consider where do we go from here? Where is consensus? What areas are ripe for research?
