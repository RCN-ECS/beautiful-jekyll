title: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement
---


The Research Coordinated Network for Evolution in Changing Seas is dedicated to promoting collaboration, networking, and the exchange of knowledge. We welcome and encourage participation by all individuals, regardless of age, culture, race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, politics, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, or subculture. We strive to cultivate a network built on encouragement, acceptance, and mutual respect, thereby engendering a welcoming environment for all. We believe that innovation arises from diversity in terms of ideas and membership. We will vigorously and proactively reject prejudice and stereotyping whenever it is encountered in our profession, be it racism, xenophobia, religious discrimination, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or any other form. We further promote diversity and equity through the development of an inclusive and supportive environment, and by fostering a focus on diversity in membership, leadership, committees, outreach, public engagement, recruitment, and in all other areas of activity within the network.
