We will be hosting a Genomics workshop at [USC Wrigley Institute](https://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/wmsc/) on Catalina Island from August 15 to August 19, 2020.  We aim to bring together 50 researchers with expertise in genomics, marine science, evolutionary biology, and oceanography. The workshop will have a combination of oral presentations, poster sessions, discussions, and brainstorming sessions.
