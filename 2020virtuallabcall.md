title: 2020 Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program
---

The RCN is excited to announce a new Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program. Selected trainees will receive a $500 stipend for completing
the program (see information on eligibility below). 

In this program, the RCN seeks to provide training to students at the undergraduate or graduate level ("mentees")
by participating in lab meetings of a research group that shares their interests. The mentee will participate by attending
lab meetings during the 2020-2021.
The Principal Investigator for the research group ("mentor") will dedicate portions of two lab meetings 
to the mentee's professional development. The format for lab meetings dedicated to the mentee's professional development is flexible, but
could take the form of review of graduate school or grant application statements at lab meeting, 
research presentation at lab meeting, lead paper discussion at lab meeting, etc.
Upon completing the program (10 lab meetings with portions of 2 lab meetings dedicated to mentee's professional development),
approved applicants will receive a $500 stipend.

We hope that this program will help mentees develop a supportive network, 
provide a pathway for mentees to future success, and broaden their knowledge in our field. Since all lab meetings 
are virtual during COVID, this is an excellent time to take advantage of these unusual circumstances with a training program.
This program is part of our [diversity initiative](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/Antiracism/).

## Eligibility to apply

We welcome and encourage applications from all students at the undergraduate or graduate level, regardless of institution or nationality, age, culture, race,

We aim to be able to place every applicant with a mentor. 

Note, however, that there are a limited number of stipends, and stipends can only be paid to US Citizens. 
Stipends will be priortized for individuals who best describe how their particiation in this program will
