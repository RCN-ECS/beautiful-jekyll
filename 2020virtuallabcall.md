title: 2020 Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program
---

The Research Coordinated Network (RCN) for Evolution in Changing Seas seeks to bring together marine scientists with evolutionary biologists to further our understanding of adaptation in the ocean. The RCN is excited to announce a new Virtual Lab Meeting Training Program. Selected trainees will receive a $500 stipend for completing
the program (see information on eligibility below). 

In this program, the RCN seeks to provide training to students at the undergraduate or graduate level ("mentees")
by participating in lab meetings of a research group that shares their interests. The mentee will participate by attending
lab meetings during the 2020-2021.
The Principal Investigator for the research group ("mentor") will dedicate portions of two lab meetings 
to the mentee's professional development. The format for lab meetings dedicated to the mentee's professional development is flexible, but
could take the form of review of graduate school or grant application statements at lab meeting, 
research presentation at lab meeting, lead paper discussion at lab meeting, etc.
Upon completing the program (10 lab meetings with portions of 2 lab meetings dedicated to mentee's professional development) before May 2021,
approved applicants will receive a $500 stipend.

If you haven't yet, please [sign up to be a member of the RCN](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/howtojoin/). It's as simple as filling out a form and signing up for our listserv!

We hope that this program will help mentees develop a supportive network, 
provide a pathway for mentees to future success, and broaden their knowledge in our field. Since all lab meetings 
are virtual during COVID, this is an excellent time to take advantage of these unusual circumstances with a training program.

To view a list of mentors who have signed up for the program and their research interests, 
[check out this table of interested mentors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_yv6PttKxSFH_p8LQwFaCGhTmmP2gbeb4ZsT-OCyv7s/edit#gid=1184638278). We encourage applicants to reach out to mentors who are not on the list and 
encourage them to sign up with [the RCN lab meeting mentor sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIWnde8XTEVKhz0vegtjYmsFlm22LhihWjODhuHm6aWZe4WQ/viewform).

## Information for mentors

Please use [the RCN lab meeting mentor sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIWnde8XTEVKhz0vegtjYmsFlm22LhihWjODhuHm6aWZe4WQ/viewform) to sign up to be a mentor for this program before Sept 15. Applications are due Sept 30, so we want applicants to have the full list of mentors two weeks ahead of time.

PIs that sign up will agree to invite the matched applicant to join 10 lab meetings and at 
least parts of 2 lab meetings will be devoted to professional development of the applicant in the fall of 2020 or spring semester of 2021 (by May 2021). 
PIs can indicate if they want to have 1 or 2 applicants.

## Information for applicants

## Eligibility to apply

We welcome and encourage applications from all students at the undergraduate or graduate level, regardless of institution or nationality, age, culture, race, 
ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, politics, 
religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, or subculture. For more information, check
out our [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/DEI/)

We aim to be able to place every applicant with a mentor. 

Note, however, that there are a limited number of stipends, and stipends can only be paid to US Citizens. 
Stipends will be priortized for individuals who best describe how their particiation in this program will
help to increase diversity of underrepresented groups in our field. In a recent RCN survey, 74% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a proportion of stipends should be prioritized to increasing underrepresented groups within the RCN. This program is part of our [antiracism response to systematic racism in society](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/Antiracism/).
