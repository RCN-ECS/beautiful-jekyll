title: 2020-2021 Call for new working groups
---

The RCN is soliciting applications from *graduate students and postdocs* for a second phase of working groups. 
Up to $10,000 in stipends can be requested for each working group to support the graduate student or postdoc activities on the working groups.
Working group activities and products can take many different forms, so please read the entire announcement to learn more. Please note, however, that the RCN 
cannot fund collection of new data. 


### Topics
The proposal should describe how a working group on this topic will advance knowledge in both marine science and evolutionary biology. 
Although we invite applications for working groups from a wide variety of topics, priority will be given to those projects associated with genomics. 
This is because the Genomics Workshop had to be canceled due to the pandemic, and the funding is now available to develop new collaborations. 

Topics that were going to be discussed at the Genomics Workshop include (see [this page](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/GenomicsWorkshop/blob/master/README.md)
for more information):
* Seascape genomics and seascape data
* Using genomic data to define management units in marine systems
* Hypothesis Testing and Integrative Analyses in Genomics
* Filtering, standards, and best practices
* Connecting genotype to phenotype with transgenics 

In addition, here is [a summmary of current working groups funded by the RCN]()

For information on what topics RCN members think are important for advancing both marine and evolutionary biology, 
[check out results from this 2019 poll](https://github.com/RCN-ECS/CnGV/blob/master/notebook/20191205_MA_PollResults.md). Note



_Rationale on format_: The Diversity Committee discussed that if we want to increase the participation of young URMs, then we should 
ask for proposals for working groups from graduate students and postdocs (with a proposed mentor). If we leave it open (anyone can apply), 
then we were worried that young people might feel intimidated, and senior people may fail to put in the effort to find someone new in their network. 
We also wanted to avoid the situation where the mentee fell into a trap of “working” to complete the PI’s research or analyze the PI’s data.
