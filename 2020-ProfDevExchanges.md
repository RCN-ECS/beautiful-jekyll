title: 2020-2021 Junior Professional Development Exchanges
---

We invite advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to apply for competitive research exchange awards ($500-$3000) aimed at expanding their area of expertise or professional network beyond their field of training. Proposed activities should fall under the themes of the RCN. For example, a student with a marine-focused research project may propose to visit a non-marine evolution lab. Conversely, a student studying evolutionary processes in a terrestrial system may propose to visit a marine lab. Applicants must be currently working at a US institution and the proposed exchange must take place in the US. Applicants need not be US citizens or permanent residents.

Applicants can propose 1 week to 2 month visits (the $3000 is only available for a 2 month visit). The applicant can propose to give a seminar, learn a skill, and/or initiate a collaboration. We anticipate funding 10-20 exchanges, depending on the number of applicants and duration of proposed visits. Applicants should provide a budget and justification for the proposed research exchange with dollar amounts in the following categories: travel, lodging, food, materials and supplies. 

If the application is approved, the applicant will receive a stipend for the amount approved (which may not equal the amount requested). The host laboratory is encouraged to provide assistance to applicants to secure appropriate housing.

Awards will be distributed to the successful applicant as a stipend based on their proposed budget. The research exchange must occur between March 2020 and March 2021.

We understand that certain individuals may have special circumstances that may make it difficultfor them to travel (e.g. pregnancy, young children, disability). If you have special circumstances, please email us at evolvingseas@gmail.com to determine if there is another way you can apply for support for your professional development.
