title: 2021 Coordinated readings
subtitle: To help inform and educate evolutionary and marine scientists about marine biodiversity conservation, we have developed a recommended reading list of papers about marine conservation and genomic applications.
---

To facilitate discussions among members of the RCN, we have set up Slack channel at [evolvingseas.slack.com](https://evolvingseas.slack.com). To join the channel please [visit this site](https://evolvingseas.slack.com).  We encourage you to discuss the papers with other participants prior to joining the larger discussion on slack. For each topic, your group should choose one person to post a summary to the Slack channel that summarizes the group’s reaction to the papers and discussion questions. We have made efforts to improve representation and diversity in our selected readings. Please scroll to the bottom of this page for a diversity summary. Please contact [Molly Albecker](m.albecker@northeastern.edu) if you encounter problems with slack or accessing any of the readings.

To form a discussion group: 1) Start a group at your home institution and meet once or twice during each two-week period (any time during the two weeks is fine) to read and discuss the papers, 2) Discuss papers virtually before joining the larger discussion via the #Virtual_Discussion group on the RCN slack. 

### Navigating Slack

All participants can use the thread feature in Slack to post additional questions, and react to comments or questions posed by other groups. We will also have a weekly thread dedicated to resolving questions that emerge from the readings. Moderators will monitor threads and respond to questions. We encourage individuals or groups to use these threads to clarify any uncertainties. 

Under `Channels` click the `+` and search for `2021-spring-readings`

Each week will have two threads: 
  * Under the thread `Week X. <Topic Name> Post your group's discussions here,` click on the chat icon `Reply to thread` to post a summary of your group's discussions (see image below).
  * To ask a question about the papers, use the thread `Week X. <Topic Name> Questions for Understanding.` If you have any technical questions about the papers, post them here and the moderators will do their best to answer them!

# Marine Conservation and Genomic Applications
Our third set of coordinated readings focuses on marine conservation and genomic applications. We live in an exciting scientific era in which it has become feasible and affordable to analyze populations at their whole genome level, even in non-model species. Conservation genomics can apply these genetic tools, methods, and concepts to the conservation and restoration of biodiversity. But with so much possibility, we are often restricted by limited time and resources. So what are the ways in which evolutionary concepts and genomic tools can best inform ocean conservation and management? 

## Discussion Questions: 
In the service of that broad question, these three questions can be used as guideposts for each week’s discussions. 
* **1. What genetic factors may lead to extinction?**

* **2. What genetic factors may lead to population stability/growth?** 

* **3. Where are we (researchers, practitioners, etc.) on data collection, interpretation, and policy implementation for each week's topic?** 


As always, a central goal of the RCN-ECS is to synthesize and integrate ideas about evolution in changing seas. Therefor the final week is for groups to gather together, synthesize previous discussions, and provide answers to the three questions. We encourage groups to generate bold and testable predictions and to distance themselves from simply summarizing past discussions.

We are grateful to this year's planning committee ([Dr. Laetitia Wilkins](https://laetitia.schmid.se/), [Dr. Lisa Komoroske](https://lmkomoroske.com/), and [Dr. Molly Albecker](mollyalbecker.com)) as well as the broader RCN community for their efforts in generating  topics, discussion questions, and scientific papers.

**We recognize that ongoing efforts to minimize transmission of Covid-19 may lead to disruptions or delays in discussions. Please note that while we post "due dates" for discussion summaries to be posted to the Slack channel, these can be viewed as guidelines for spacing out discussions and are not hard cutoffs.**

## Diversity Statement for Coordinated Readings: 
As stated in the RCN-ECS’s [diversity](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/DEI/) and [anti-racism](https://rcn-ecs.github.io/Antiracism/) statements, we value diverse perspectives and are committed to amplifying the research authored by historically under-represented groups including women, LGBTQ+ persons, non-binary persons, and Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC). In keeping with this goal, we emphasized this aim in our solicitation for topic and paper nominations from the larger RCN community, purposefully requesting nominations from diverse scientists. Our organizing committee took additional steps to choose an inclusive set of papers that highlight the work of diverse scientists in these key topic areas (for example, searching for additional candidates on https://diversifyeeb.com/ and https://blackinmarsci.github.io/). Collectively, 18 out of the 21 papers included authors from non-US institutions, at least 14 papers had female-identifying authors, and at least 7 of the 21 papers included BIPOC authors. Despite these efforts, we recognize that there are limitations to our approach, and that the fields of marine science and evolutionary biology have important work to do to build an inclusive and equitable culture. For inquiries about this process or suggestions to further advance these goals in future coordinated readings please contact [Molly Albecker](m.albecker@northeastern.edu).
